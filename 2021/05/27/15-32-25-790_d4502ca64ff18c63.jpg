With today\u2019s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $500 million (\u20ac415 million). Agicap is building a service that lets you track your cash flow in real time, build reports and get forecasts.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Greenoaks, existing investors BlackFin Capital Partners and Partech are also participating in the round. It represents a big jump from last year\u2019s $18 million Series A round.<\/p>\n<p>The basic premise of Agicap is quite simple. Many small companies rely on Microsoft Excel to figure out their cash position every week or every month. Instead of exporting .csv files from your bank accounts, you can connect your bank accounts to Agicap for real-time monitoring. Similarly, Agicap has developed integrations with accounting software and invoicing tools.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When you want to see how you\u2019re doing when it comes to cash, you can connect to your Agicap account just like you\u2019d connect to a web analytics service. Agicap tries to break down how much you\u2019re spending by category and branch. After that, you can run projections and make decisions based on forecasts.<\/p>\n<p>Designed specifically for small and medium companies, Agicap has managed to convince 3,500 companies to use its service. They pay a monthly subscription fee. Clients include Cityscoot, Meero, Merci Handy, Ornikar and Blend Burger.<\/p>\n<p>Agicap is currently live in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. France still generates 50% of the company\u2019s revenue but other markets are growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis Series B comes at a key moment in our development,\u201d co-founder and CEO S\u00e9bastien Beyet said in a statement. \u201cIt demonstrates our will to make Agicap the European leader in our market and will allow us to further accelerate our international presence, launching in 10 new countries in the coming months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Following today\u2019s funding round, the company has some ambitious expansion plans. The company\u2019s team has already grown from 30 employees to 200 employees over the last 12 months. Now, it plans to build a team of 1,000 employees within the next couple of years.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup Agicap has raised a new $100 million funding round led by Greenoaks.

showed off the final version of its all-electric Air sedan, the company has finally revealed the in-cabin tech \u2014 from the curved 34-inch display and second touchscreen to the underlying software, integrated apps and Amazon Alexa voice assistant \u2014 that drivers and passengers will use once the automaker begins deliveries of the vehicle in the second half of the year.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the company&#8217;s branded Lucid User Experience, or Lucid UX, is to include all the tech that customers might want in a vehicle priced between $80,000 and $169,000 without adding clutter and confusion.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We really tried to follow a strong principle of ease-of-use and a short learning curve, for it to have quick responses and an overall feeling of elegance,&#8221; Derek Jenkins, Lucid&#8217;s head of design said in a recent interview. &#8220;I kind of wanted to move away from it being overly technical or sci-fi looking or spreadsheet-like and really move towards something that was more fitting with the brand and our design ethos.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The interior isn&#8217;t as stark as a Tesla Model 3 or Tesla Model Y, nor as jam-packed as some of the German luxury vehicles. Jenkins and his team have tried to hit the Goldilocks&#8217;s equivalent the perfect bowl of tech porridge.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At the beginning of the project I always used to tell the team, &#8216;Listen I want my mom to be able to get in this car and figure it out the first time,&#8217; &#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;She should be able to know instinctively probably the light switch and the door locks are on the left side because that&#8217;s where they always are and not have to dig through that stuff. Or that the climate controls are probably on the lower screen because that&#8217;s where it often is and traditionally has been. I just felt like it should have intuitiveness and a degree of simplicity, while still having impressive features and having a system that can grow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158000\" style=\"width: 3850px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158000\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2158000 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg\" alt=\"Lucid Motors interior cabin\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lucid Motors<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>The hardware<\/h2>\n<p>The curved 34-inch 5K display called the glass cockpit floats slightly above the dashboard and is the most visible hardware in the vehicle, although is not the only component worth mentioning.

The driver or passenger can swipe menus from the home screen down to the pilot panel to display in-depth controls for music or navigation. And if the driver doesn&#8217;t want that additional touchscreen, the pilot panel can be retracted, opening access to a storage space behind it.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that analog switches are still within the vehicle in three areas: the doors, the steering wheel and a slice of space between the pilot panel and the upper home screen. Alongside the doors, the driver or passengers will find the window switches and interior door latches. Right above the center console display are four physical buttons that lets the driver or passenger control climate temperature and fan speed.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158057\" style=\"width: 3850px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158057\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2158057 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158057\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lucid Motors<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the steering wheel is a touch bar and two toggles. These buttons can be used to launch the Alexa voice assistant and turn on and off the advanced driver assistance functions, as well as adjust the following distance in cruise control and volume.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We did a lot of research through this discussion of analog interaction such as physical buttons and digital interaction on a touchscreen,&#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;What we found was there was some key functionality that people still wanted to have physical interaction with.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The vehicle is also loaded with 32 sensors, including a single lidar that is located just below the nose blade on the exterior of the vehicle. Below that is a lower air intake and then a forward-facing radar. Other radar sensors are located on the exterior corners. There are exterior cameras, as well, in the nose and header area behind the rearview mirror.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the vehicle, and tucked right below the instrument cluster, is a camera that faces the driver. This camera is part of the driver-monitoring system, which is meant to ensure the operator is paying attention when the advanced driver assistance system is engaged.<\/p>\n<p>Two other hardware items worth noting are the 21-speaker surround sound system from Dolby Atmos and a small vintage (and Miata-esque) detail with the air vents. Lucid wanted the Air to have physical air vents that a person could touch and move &#8212; unlike the Tesla Model 3, which requires the user to move the direction of the air flow through the digital touchscreen. But Lucid didn&#8217;t want the bulk of a vent in the chiclet-style design, which has an additional side tab to turn on or off the air flow.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is a slimmed-down air vent with a single round dial right in the middle. That dial can be grabbed and moved to shift air flow. It also can be turned to shut off the air to a particular vent.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a breakthrough for us,&#8221; Jenkins said laughing, &#8220;which isn&#8217;t a breakthrough because that was super common in the 60s and 70s in cars.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The software<\/h2>\n<p>Behind all of the physical touchscreens and sensors is the software that delivers functions and services.<\/p>\n<p>Lucid started with the open-source Android Automotive operating system and built out the apps and other features from there. Android Automotive OS is modeled after Google&#8217;s Android open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. Google has offered an open-source version of this OS to automakers for some time. In recent years, automakers have worked with Google to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store. Lucid did not take the Google services platform route.<\/p>\n<p>From here, Lucid worked with various third-party apps and integrated them into the infotainment system, a list that currently includes\u00a0iHeartRadio, TuneIn, Pocket Casts, Dolby Atmos, Tidal and Spotify.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7iXdOxIviF\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit\/\">Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit\/embed\/#?secret=7iXdOxIviF\" data-secret=\"7iXdOxIviF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Lucid has also decided to make Alexa the default and primary integrated voice control system. Lucid Air will also come with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \u2014 apps that run on the user\u2019s phone and wirelessly communicate with the vehicle\u2019s infotainment system. This means the driver, or passenger, can access Google Assistant and Siri through these apps, they just won&#8217;t be able to control the vehicle functions like climate.<\/p>\n<p>The vehicle will also have integrated mobile and Wi-Fi connectivity, which will allow Lucid to update the software of the vehicle wirelessly. The over-the-air update capability lets the company add new apps and services.<\/p>\n<h2>The future<\/h2>\n<p>Jenkins said they&#8217;re already looking at bringing more content to the infotainment system, including gaming and video streaming, which would only be accessible when the vehicle is parked.<\/p>\n<p>The Lucid design team is also examining other more hardware-based additions to future model years of the Air, including rear entertainment displays.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You probably won&#8217;t see that from us until sometime in 2023,&#8221; Jenkins noted. &#8220;We think that&#8217;s an important thing to bring to the car especially because the rear seat is such a nice place to be.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"

few<\/span> short years, Vise has gone from launching on the Disrupt Battlefield stage to unicorn. Co-founders Samir Vasavada and Runik Mehrotra met Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire at an afterparty at the event, and Maguire ended up leading a seed and Series A round while Sequoia led the Series B. Last week, Vise raised its Series C of $65 million and was officially valued at $1 billion post-money.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tA good pitch deck is short and simple, and covers the key points in less than 12 words a slide.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>We sat down with Vasavada and Maguire to talk about the early fundraising process for Vise, specifically the seed round, and get a look at the startup&#8217;s first pitch deck. We discussed what Vasavada has learned about delivering a good fundraising pitch, and what stood out about the pitch and the product for Maguire.<\/p>\n<h2>Simplicity is key<\/h2>\n<p>Vasavada says he&#8217;s made dozens of pitch decks since starting Vise and that this early deck was not his best because it was trying to do too much.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A good pitch deck is short and simple, and covers the key points in less than 12 words a slide,&#8221; said Vasavada, adding that many founders think they need to show investors every part of their business.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The deck has to show that you&#8217;re solving an important problem, that you&#8217;ve got the path to an important solution, that there is a big market opportunity, and that your team is positioned to execute,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are the only four things that matter. Everything else can be discussed in the Q&amp;A.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The goal of a pitch meeting is not to get the &#8220;yes&#8221; instantly, and satisfy every curiosity, but rather to give the investor something to think about and a reason to want another conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Vasavada explained to the audience that this early seed deck certainly went into too much detail and was too text-heavy. (You can check out the full deck below.)<\/p>\n<h2>Why will this product be successful right now?<\/h2>\n<p>Beyond the problem, solution, market and team, there is an additional X factor that makes a difference in pitching for fundraising.<\/p>\n<p>Timing can make or break a startup.

Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT Rules.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>A Twitter spokesperson added: \u201cWe plan to advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian Government and believe it is critical to adopt a collaborative approach. It is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry, and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tension between American tech giants Twitter and Facebook and the Indian government has been brewing for months. Twitter faced heat from politicians after it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/09\/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning\/\">refused to block accounts<\/a> that criticised New Delhi\u2019s reforms and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.<\/p>\n<p>India is one of the largest markets for American tech firms that poured billions of dollars in the South Asian nation in the past decade to get more people connected to the web. According to Indian government estimates, Twitter has 175 million users in India, while WhatsApp has amassed over 530 million users.<\/p>\n<p>Their tension escalated Wednesday after WhatsApp <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/whatsapp-sues-india-government\/\">sued the Indian government<\/a> in a court in Delhi over the new IT rules that it said would compromise users\u2019 privacy and give New Delhi the power to conduct mass surveillance.<\/p>\n<p>India announced the new IT rules in February and gave firms three months to comply. The deadline expired this week, and on Wednesday the Ministry of Electronics and IT <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/india-asks-social-media-firms-if-they-have-complied-with-the-new-regulations\/\">asked social media firms for an update on their compliant status<\/a>, TechCrunch first reported.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter said Thursday that the new IT rules\u2019 requirements to make a compliance officer criminally liable for content on the platform, proactive monitoring, and blanket authority to seek information about users represented a dangerous overreach that was inconsistent with open and democratic principles.<\/p>\n<p>The microblogging platform also requested New Delhi to consider granting a minimum of 3 months extension to comply with the new IT rules and publish Standard Operating Protocols on aspects of compliance of public consultation.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter said it was recently served with another non-compliance notice in India and withheld a portion of the content identified in the notice under. The content identified in the notice, Twitter said, was originally reported in the blocking orders since February 2021.<\/p>\n<p>It said in recent months it has been compelled to withhold content in response to a non-compliance notice. Not doing so, it said, poses penal consequences with many risks for Twitter employees.<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company is committed to complying with the new IT rules. &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously early days and our local teams are very engaged. You know we comply with local laws and we will approach it with the same framework,&#8221; he said in a briefing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We engage and explain to everyone the importance of information, promoting free flow of information, but we do want to respect legislative processes in democratic countries. We are committed to complying,&#8221; he said, adding that the company will highlight any requests it complies with in its transparency reports.<\/p>\n<p>India&#8217;s response to Twitter&#8217;s statement today:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Press Release by Ministry of Electronics and IT in response to the statements made by Twitter Inc. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/hQxCGuoEaG\">pic.twitter.com\/hQxCGuoEaG<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Ministry of Electronics &amp; IT (@GoI_MeitY) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GoI_MeitY\/status\/1397895486904836096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KIbpENoURR\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/india-says-whatsapps-lawsuit-over-new-regulations-a-clear-act-of-defiance\/\">India says WhatsApp&#8217;s lawsuit over new regulations a clear act of defiance<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;India says WhatsApp&#8217;s lawsuit over new regulations a clear act of defiance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/india-says-whatsapps-lawsuit-over-new-regulations-a-clear-act-of-defiance\/embed\/#?secret=KIbpENoURR\" data-secret=\"KIbpENoURR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter called the recent visit by police to its Indian offices a form of intimidation and said it was concerned by some of the requirements in New Delhi\u2019s new IT rules.

Except that instead of create the more traditional business she once had in mind, Madhavan found herself tinkering with an entirely different idea: a matchmaking app called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schmoozedating.com\/\">Schmooze<\/a> that combines machine learning and memes to connect people based on what Madhavan calls a humor algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>The idea dates back several years when, as an analyst with McKinsey in India who was debating whether or not to attend grad school in California, Madhavan cold-emailed 10 people on LinkedIn who had attended U.S. business schools for advice. Only one of them replied, but over the next couple of days, she says, &#8220;we exchanged, like, 200 emails, all of them fundamentally jokes.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Reader, she is now married to that person.

Though it hasn&#8217;t yet spread Facebook-like across college campuses, a beta test in late summer with 200 Stanford students has since led to more than 10,000 downloads around the country, where people are swiping right &#8212; or left &#8212; to more than 5,000 memes that are culled entirely by still-in-beta Schmooze (until it&#8217;s big enough to deal with content moderation).<\/p>\n<p>Currently about 200 memes are added each day, while others are deleted. &#8220;No one cares about the U.S. elections anymore,&#8221; Madhavan notes.<\/p>\n<p>Using tagging and machine learning, combined with the bios that users create for themselves, Schmooze gets to work. Some users might show a predilection for particular topics, for example, like physics or finance. Some who say they&#8217;re interested in entrepreneurship might reveal an even stronger passion for music through their choices. There are similar divides when it comes to dark humor, and people who really love puns &#8212; and those who hate them.<\/p>\n<p>Whether the algorithm truly works will take time, and lasting unions, to know. Madhavan says that 90,000 matches have been made to date, but naturally, a far smaller number have moved from matched to in-app messaging.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ERZ4l4H38j\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/15\/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes\/\">Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/15\/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes\/embed\/#?secret=ERZ4l4H38j\" data-secret=\"ERZ4l4H38j\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Schmooze has plenty of competition in the meantime, both from traditional dating platforms and from newer apps and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/05\/19\/style\/marriage-pact-college-stanford.html\">questionnaires<\/a> that try pairing people based on share interests rather than <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/15\/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes\/\">looks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also easy to imagine more meme-based dating apps suddenly springing into existence, particularly given today&#8217;s go-go market.

delays deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition by one month"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Rivian said that deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition, the limited edition release of its first series of \u201celectric adventure vehicles,\u201d will be delayed by a month, according to an update on its website.<\/p>\n<p>Customers who preordered can now expect to start receiving their pickup trucks in July instead of June, with Launch Edition deliveries to be completed by Spring 2022. The change was first spotted by the Rivian Forum.<\/p>\n<p>The Amazon-backed EV startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/24\/rivian-to-begin-deliveries-of-electric-pickup-truck-in-june-2021\/\">told preorder holders in July 2020<\/a> to expect deliveries of the truck in June 2021, with R1S electric SUV deliveries starting two months later in August. The delivery timeline has already been extended once, after Rivian <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/20\/rivian-shuts-down-all-facilities-over-covid-19-pandemic-concerns\/\">suspended construction work<\/a> on its factory due to the coronavirus pandemic.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It also appears that the R1S SUV has been delayed by several months, according to the website, which states that all R1T and R1S Launch Edition preorder holders will hear from their designation Rivian customer rep &#8220;by the end of November with their expected delivery timing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Rivian did not immediately respond with a request for comment. TechCrunch update the article, if they do.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the delay, it looks like Rivian will still be first to bring an electric truck to market among both new EV entrants and legacy automakers. Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns said in an investor call last week that deliveries for the company\u2019s \u201cEndurance\u201d truck are still on track for September (despite <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup\/\">slashing production numbers in half<\/a>). Ford\u2019s F-150 Lighting, the electric version of its nameplate pickup, is expected in 2022. And Tesla recently confirmed that its Cybertruck will start production late this year.<\/p>\n<p>Rivian also said it will be starting its drive program in August, which will let customers schedule at-home drives or attend a tour event. The company will be releasing details on launch dates and reservations for the tour events in the coming weeks. Rivian selected Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Detroit and Seattle as the first batch of cities on the tour.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, it released a few product updates. Customers now have the option to add an Off-Road Upgrade to their vehicle configuration for an additional $2,000. Every Rivian will now also come with an onboard air compressor, previously available only with the Off-Road Upgrade.<\/p>\n<p>Customers can also add Rivian Adventure Gear to their configuration. These include a rooftop tent, cargo bars, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/08\/rivians-camp-kitchen-in-action\/\">camp kitchen<\/a> (that now comes with a 30-piece kitchen set).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OqMcfbDvs7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup\/\">Lordstown Motors slashes production forecast for its electric pickup<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Lordstown Motors slashes production forecast for its electric pickup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup\/embed\/#?secret=OqMcfbDvs7\" data-secret=\"OqMcfbDvs7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rivian said that deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition, the limited edition release of its first series of \u201celectric adventure vehicles,\u201d will be delayed by a month, according to an update on its website.

the video conferencing software, kicks off summer with a bunch of new features"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/mmhmm\/\">mmhmm<\/a>, the communications platform developed by Phil Libin and the All Turtles team, is getting a variety of new features. According to Libin, there are parts of communication today that can not only match what we get in the real world, but exceed it.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how this next iteration of mmhmm is meant to deliver.<\/p>\n<p>The new headline feature is mmhmm Chunky, which allows the presenter to break up their script and presentation into &#8216;chunks&#8217;. Think of the presenter the same way you think of slides in a deck. Each one gets the full edit treatment and final polish. With Chunky, mmhmm users can break up their presentation into chunks to perfect each individual bit of information.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>A presenter can switch between live and pre-recorded chunks in a presentation. So you can imagine a salesman making a pitch and switching over to his explanation of the pricing as a pre-recorded piece of his pitch, or a teacher who has a pre-recorded chunk on a particular topic can throw to that mid-class.<\/p>\n<p>But mmhmm didn&#8217;t just think about the creation side, but the consumption side. Folks in the audience can jump around between chunks and slides to catch up, or even view in a sped up mode to consume more quickly. Presenters can see where folks in the audience are as they present or later on.<\/p>\n<p>Libin sees this feature as a way to supercharge time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At mmhmm, we stopped doing synchronous updates with our fully distributed team,&#8221; said Libin. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have meetings anymore where people take turns updating each other because it&#8217;s not very efficient. Now the team just sends around their quick presentations, and I can watch it in double speed because people can listen faster than people can talk. But we don&#8217;t have to do it at the same time. Then, when we actually talk synchronously, it&#8217;s reserved for that live back-and-forth about the important stuff.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>mmhmm is also announcing that it has developed its own video player, allowing folks to stream their mmhmm presentations to whatever website they&#8217;d like. As per usual, mmhmm will still work with Zoom, Google Meet, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The new features list also includes an updated version of Copilot. For folks who remember, Copilot allowed one person to present and another person to &#8216;drive,&#8217; or art direct, the presentation from the background. Copilot 2.0 lets two people essentially video chat side by side, in whatever environment they&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n<p>Libin showed me a presentation\/conversation he did with a friend where they were both framed up in Libin&#8217;s house. He clarified that this feature works best with one-on-one conversations, or, one-on-one conversations in front of a large audience, such as a fireside chat.<\/p>\n<p>Alongside mmhmm Chunky, streaming, and Copilot 2.0, the platform is also doing a bit of spring cleaning with regards to organization. Users will have a Presentation Library where they can save and organize their best takes, and organizations can also use &#8216;Loaf&#8217; to store all the best videos and presentations company wide for consumption later. The team also revamped Presets to make it easier to apply a preset to a bunch of slides at once or switch between presets more easily.<\/p>\n<p>A couple other notes: mmhmm is working to bring the app to both iOS and Android very soon, and launch out of beta on Windows.<\/p>\n<p>Libin explained that not every single feature described here will launch today, but rather you&#8217;ll see features trickle out each week as we head into summer. He&#8217;ll be giving a keynote on the new features <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mmhmm.app\/events\/#welcome-to-mmhmm-summer\">here<\/a> at 10am PT\/1pm ET.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>mmhmm, the communications platform developed by Phil Libin and the All Turtles team, is getting a variety of new features.

startup based in Australia wants to change that, and today it announced an $8 million seed round.<\/p>\n<p>Andreesen Horowitz led the investment with help from Accel and Ryan Sanders, the co-founder of BambooHR and Scott Farquar, co-founder and co-CEO at Atlassian.<\/p>\n<p>That last one isn&#8217;t a coincidence as Pyn co-founder and CEO Joris Luijke used to run HR at the company and later at Squarespace and other companies, and he saw a common problem trying to provide more targeted messages when communicating internally.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to do this my entire professional life, trying to personalize the communication that we&#8217;re sending to our people. So that&#8217;s what Pyn does. In a nutshell, we radically personalize employee communications,&#8221; Luijke explained. His co-founder Jon Williams was previously a co-founder at Culture Amp, an employee experience management platform he helped launch in 2011 (and which raised over $150 million), so the two of them have been immersed in this idea.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"F6rjlFuXcX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/create-a-handbook-and-integrate-ai-to-onboard-remote-employees\/\">Create a handbook and integrate AI to onboard remote employees<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Create a handbook and integrate AI to onboard remote employees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/create-a-handbook-and-integrate-ai-to-onboard-remote-employees\/embed\/#?secret=F6rjlFuXcX\" data-secret=\"F6rjlFuXcX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>They bring personalization to Pyn by tracking information in existing systems that companies already use such as Workday, BambooHR, Salesforce or Zendesk, and they can use this data much in the same way a marketer uses various types of information to send more personalized messages to customers.<\/p>\n<p>That means you can cut down on the company-wide emails that might not be relevant to everyone and send messages that should matter more to the people receiving them. And as with a marketing communications tool, you can track how many people have opened the emails and how successful you were in hitting the mark.<\/p>\n<p>David Ulevitch, general partner at a16z, and lead investor in this deal points out that Pyn also provides a library of customizable communications materials to help build culture and set policy across an organization.&#8221;It also treats employee communication channels as the rails upon which to orchestrate management practices across an organization [by delivering] a library of management playbooks,&#8221; Ulevitch wrote in a blog post announcing the investment.<\/p>\n<p>The startup, which launched in 2019, currently has 10 employees with teams working in Australia and the Bay Area in California. Williams says that already half the team is female and the plan is to continue putting diversity front and center as they build the company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Joris has mentioned &#8216;radical personalization&#8217; as this specific mantra that we have, and I think if you translate that into an organization, that is all about inclusion in reality, and if we want to be able to cater for all the specific needs of people, we need to understand them. So [diversity is essential] to us,&#8221; Williams said.<\/p>\n<p>While the company isn&#8217;t ready to discuss specifics in terms of customer numbers, it cites Shopify, Rubrik and Carta as early customers, and the founders say that there was a lot of interest when the pandemic hit last year and the need for more frequent and meaningful types of communication became even more paramount.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iQcEvSmJHc\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/workday-nabs-employee-feedback-platform-peakon-for-700m\/\">Workday nabs employee feedback platform Peakon for $700M<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Workday nabs employee feedback platform Peakon for $700M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/workday-nabs-employee-feedback-platform-peakon-for-700m\/embed\/#?secret=iQcEvSmJHc\" data-secret=\"iQcEvSmJHc\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most marketers today know how to send targeted communications to customers, and there are many tools to help, but when it comes to sending personalized in-house messages, there aren&#8217;t nearly as many options.

the Court of Justice (CJEU) &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism\/\">aka, Schrems II<\/a> &#8212; which struck down the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/19\/more-legal-uncertainty-for-privacy-shield-ahead-of-crux-ruling-by-europes-top-court\/\">EU-US Privacy Shield data transfer agreement<\/a> and cast doubt upon the viability of alternative data transfer mechanisms in cases where EU users&#8217; personal data is flowing to third countries where it may be at risk from mass

height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In October, the EU&#8217;s chief privacy regulator asked the bloc&#8217;s institutions to report on their transfers of personal data to non-EU countries. This analysis confirmed that data is flowing to third countries, the EDPS said today. And that it&#8217;s flowing to the U.S. in particular &#8212; on account of EU bodies&#8217; reliance on large cloud service providers (many of which are U.S.-based).<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s hardly a surprise. But the next step could be very interesting as the EDPS wants to determine whether those historical contracts (which were signed before the Schrems II ruling) align with the CJEU judgement or not.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the EDPS warned today that they may not &#8212; which could thus require EU bodies to find alternative cloud service providers in the future (most likely ones located within the EU, to avoid any legal uncertainty). So this investigation could be the start of a regulator-induced migration in the EU away from U.S. cloud giants.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, Wiewi\u00f3rowski said: &#8220;Following the outcome of the reporting exercise by the EU institutions and bodies, we identified certain types of contracts that require particular attention and this is why we have decided to launch these two investigations. I am aware that the &#8216;Cloud II contracts&#8217; were signed in early 2020 before the &#8216;Schrems II&#8217; judgement and that both Amazon and Microsoft have announced new measures with the aim to align themselves with the judgement. Nevertheless, these announced measures may not be sufficient to ensure full compliance with EU data protection law and hence the need to investigate this properly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amazon and Microsoft have been contacted with questions regarding any special measures they have applied to these Cloud II contracts with EU bodies.<\/p>\n<p>The EDPS said it wants EU institutions to lead by example. And that looks important given how, despite a public warning from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/24\/no-grace-period-after-schrems-ii-privacy-shield-ruling-warn-eu-data-watchdogs\/\">last year<\/a> &#8212; saying there would be no regulatory grace period for implementing the implications of the Schrems II judgement &#8212; there hasn&#8217;t been any major data transfer fireworks yet.<\/p>\n<p>The most likely reason for that is a fair amount of head-in-the-sand reaction and\/or superficial tweaks made to contracts in the hopes of meeting the legal bar (but which haven&#8217;t yet been tested by regulatory scrutiny).<\/p>\n<p>Final guidance from the EDPB is also still pending, although the Board put out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/11\/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook\/\">detailed advice last fall<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The CJEU ruling made it plain that EU law in this area cannot simply be ignored. So as the bloc&#8217;s data regulators start scrutinizing contracts that are taking data out of the EU some of these arrangement are, inevitably, going to be found wanting &#8212; and their associated data flows ordered to stop.<\/p>\n<p>To wit: A long-running complaint against Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers &#8212; filed by the eponymous Max Schrems, a long-time EU privacy campaigners and lawyer, all the way back in 2013 &#8212; is slowing winding toward just such a possibility.<\/p>\n<p>Last fall, following the Schrems II ruling, the Irish regulator gave Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling\/\">a preliminary order to stop moving Europeans&#8217; data<\/a> over the pond. Facebook sought to challenge that in the Irish courts but<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/14\/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows\/\"> lost its attempt to block the proceeding<\/a> earlier this month. So it could now face a suspension order within months.<\/p>\n<p>How Facebook might respond is anyone&#8217;s guess but <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/25\/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two\/\">Schrems suggested<\/a> to TechCrunch last summer that the company will ultimately need to federate its service, storing EU users&#8217; data inside the EU.<\/p>\n<p>The Schrems II ruling does generally look like it will be good news for EU-based cloud service providers which can position themselves to solve the legal uncertainty issue (even if they aren&#8217;t as competitively priced and\/or scalable as the dominant US-based cloud giants).<\/p>\n<p>Fixing U.S. surveillance law, meanwhile &#8212; so that it gets independent oversight and accessible redress mechanisms for non-citizens in order to no longer be considered a threat to EU people&#8217;s data, as the CJEU judges have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/06\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s\/\">repeatedly found<\/a> &#8212; is certainly likely to take a lot longer than &#8216;months&#8217;. If indeed the US authorities can ever be convinced of the need to reform their approach.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if EU regulators finally start taking action on Schrems II &#8212; by ordering high profile EU-US data transfers to stop &#8212; that might help concentrate US policymakers&#8217; minds toward surveillance reform. Otherwise local storage may be the new future normal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IlpZqqB7nB\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown\/\">Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers face their final countdown<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers face their final countdown&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown\/embed\/#?secret=IlpZqqB7nB\" data-secret=\"IlpZqqB7nB\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DAIsSfG3Ie\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling\/\">Facebook told it may have to suspend EU data transfers after Schrems II ruling<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook told it may have to suspend EU data transfers after Schrems II ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/09\/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling\/embed\/#?secret=DAIsSfG3Ie\" data-secret=\"DAIsSfG3Ie\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"koY2mCJAkL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/european-parliament-amps-up-pressure-on-eu-us-data-flows-and-gdpr-enforcement\/\">European Parliament amps up pressure on EU-US data flows and GDPR enforcement<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;European Parliament amps up pressure on EU-US data flows and GDPR enforcement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/european-parliament-amps-up-pressure-on-eu-us-data-flows-and-gdpr-enforcement\/embed\/#?secret=koY2mCJAkL\" data-secret=\"koY2mCJAkL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"r4E0Nh6m60\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling\/\">Legal clouds gather over US cloud services, after CJEU ruling<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Legal clouds gather over US cloud services, after CJEU ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling\/embed\/#?secret=r4E0Nh6m60\" data-secret=\"r4E0Nh6m60\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"csmotq6nk8\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/21\/eu-contracts-with-microsoft-raising-serious-data-concerns-says-watchdog\/\">EU contracts with Microsoft raising &#8216;serious&#8217; data concerns, says watchdog<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;EU contracts with Microsoft raising &#8216;serious&#8217; data concerns, says watchdog&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/21\/eu-contracts-with-microsoft-raising-serious-data-concerns-says-watchdog\/embed\/#?secret=csmotq6nk8\" data-secret=\"csmotq6nk8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Europe&#8217;s lead data protection regulator has opened two investigations into EU institutions&#8217; use of cloud services from U.S. cloud giants, Amazon and Microsoft, under so called Cloud II contracts inked earlier between European bodies, institutions and agencies and AWS and Microsoft.

One year sequestered in our homes later, and our living spaces have flourished into our personal indoor gardens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An app that uses machine learning to help people care for their plants, Greg announced today that it has received $5.4 million in seed funding. This round is led by Index with participation from First Round Capital. Greg is also backed by a team of expert angels and advisors, including Elie Seidman (previous CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/vaccinated-badges-free-boosts-tinder-bumble-okcupid-blk-chispa\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tinder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), Eliza Blank (founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesill.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sill<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a plant delivery service), and Darryl Cheng (a \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/houseplantjournal\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plant-stagrammer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d with 600k followers). Currently, Greg&#8217;s remote team has 11 members and <a href=\"https:\/\/boards.greenhouse.io\/gregarious\">plans to hire<\/a> a Head of Brand and at least five more engineers, including a Senior Android Engineer (so far, the app is only available on iOS).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Primarily, Greg works by telling people when to water their plants \u2013 that\u2019s not something you can just set a weekly reminder for, since every plant is a bit different. Greg\u2019s recommendations are tailored to each plant\u2019s species, geographic location, sun exposure, and proximity to a window. This makes it easy for anyone to keep their greenery thriving in any circumstance. There\u2019s also a discover feed built into the app, where users can share photos of their plants, which have names like \u201cKeanu Leaves\u201d and \u201cMichelle Branch.\u201d<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158250\" style=\"width: 404px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158250\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2158250 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot2.jpg?w=394\" alt=\"\" width=\"394\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot2.jpg 750w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=87,150 87w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=174,300 174w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=394,680 394w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=29,50 29w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/greg.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greg <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For CEO, co-founder, and engineer Alex Ross, plant care is more than just a pandemic hobby. Gregarious, Inc. \u2013 the company behind Greg \u2013 was founded as a public benefit corporation. In a legally-binding <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/greg.app\/charter\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">public statement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the team promises to produce a positive effect (\u201cor a reduction of negative effects\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s where we\u2019re at with climate change) within Earth\u2019s ecosystems. The company&#8217;s charter outlines three goals: developing original technology and research to deepen our understanding of plant life; acting as stewards of the planet&#8217;s health; and creating opportunities for all forms of life to thrive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPlants are a really great vehicle for understanding how the planet works,\u201d said Ross. \u201cThat\u2019s one of our core reasons for starting Greg. We believe that more people need to understand how ecosystems work, how plants work, and how our food system works in order for us to make better decisions as a society in the next 10 or 20 years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn\u2019t Ross\u2019s first experience with mission-driven entrepreneurship. As a Director of Engineering at Tinder, he created the Trust &amp; Safety team, which is responsible for keeping the dating app\u2019s users safe from abuse. There, he saw the potential for consumer mobile apps to build an audience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Tinder was actually on the leading edge of trust and safety products,&#8221; said Ross. &#8220;I wanted to work on the part of Tinder that had a clear public benefit. Now [with Greg], the public benefit is the point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Since its public launch on the app store in October 2020, Greg has sprouted 50,000 monthly active users. These green thumbs have added 350,000 plants across 4,000 different species, which they\u2019ve interacted with over 2 million times. The app\u2019s methodology is based on the UN Food &amp; Agriculture Organization\u2019s algorithm for estimating crop water use. Every interaction helps Greg\u2019s AI get smarter \u2013 whether that\u2019s taking photos, watering a plant, or even snoozing watering recommendations. The more data that Greg\u2019s AI interprets, the more it learns about the most effective and efficient ways to grow plants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe hope within a number of years to be contributing back to that UN Food &amp; Agriculture Organization algorithm to make it easier for farmers in developing countries to be able to take that algorithm and grow higher yield produce for their food systems,\u201d said Ross. \u201cThat\u2019s why we started as a public benefit corporation.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross says that the biggest challenge facing Greg is that people don\u2019t know about it yet. So, the app partnered with plant retailers like House Plant Shop and American Plant Exchange to share promotion codes for its subscription tier, Super Greg. Subscribers pay $6.50 per month, $2.50 per month annually, or $49.99 for lifetime access, which allows them to add unlimited plants to Greg \u2013 the free version only lets you add five plants, which may not be sufficient for the budding botanists among us.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat\u2019s been a great source of user acquisition,\u201d Ross says. Once on the app, they can better understand the fickle ecosystems of their plants. \u201cWe think Greg can play a role in onboarding people. Coinbase onboards people into crypto, Greg onboards people into plants.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158249\" style=\"width: 404px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158249\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2158249 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot3.jpg?w=394\" alt=\"\" width=\"394\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot3.jpg 750w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot3.jpg?resize=87,150 87w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot3.jpg?resize=174,300 174w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot3.jpg?resize=394,680 394w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/greg_screenshot3.jpg?resize=29,50 29w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/greg.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greg <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ross also compared Greg\u2019s model to an app like Waze \u2013 as more users report traffic patterns, the app can increasingly benefit other drivers in their area. In the same vein, as Greg learns more about plant maintenance, the company can use that data to fulfill its eco-friendly mission.

The company&#8217;s system complies with the FAA&#8217;s Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC), enabling drone pilots to submit operations while flying in controlled airspace. The company is one of seven FAA-approved companies to provide this service.<\/p>\n<p>With the Series A funding, Healander says the goal is to integrate with as many transportation groups as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2018 by Michael Healander, Daniel Bradshaw, and Ana Healander, the Detroit-based startup employs 20 full-time staff. The company says in a press release that it has partnerships with over 40 government agencies and municipalities in the United States. Going forward, the company is looking to expand to Australia and Canada.<\/p>\n<p>According to Healander, what distinguishes Airspace Link from the other competitors in the market is its integration with mapping tools used by municipal governments to provide information on ground-based risk.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our core purpose is to safely integrate drones into the national airspace and our communities at scale,&#8221; said Healander. &#8220;We thank Altos Ventures and Thales for joining our vision of paving the way for the drone economy with shared, neutral, and affordable UAS infrastructure.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Healander, Airspace Link is only the latest entrepreneurial venture.

The launch comes just a week after Bird announced a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Switchback II. The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly\/\">regulatory filings<\/a> that accompanied the announcement\u00a0demonstrated just how difficult it is to turn a profit given the unit economics of shared scooters.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of building and servicing vehicles is one of the biggest barriers to profitability, which explains why Bird has invested in developing a scooter with a longer-lasting vehicle and battery as well as the software needed to monitor the device&#8217;s health.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Bird writes its own proprietary operating system, called Bird OS, as well as its motor controller IoT system, according to Scott Rushforth, Bird&#8217;s chief vehicle officer. The self-diagnostics system allows the battery to communicate with the backend and internally within the connected vehicle network. That means if, for example, the machine gets too warm, it&#8217;ll send the server an alert and will also automatically correct itself by riding at a slower speed to keep cool.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s tons of health monitoring and data that comes off the battery,&#8221; Rushforth told TechCrunch. &#8220;Every individual cell is monitored. There&#8217;s probably about 75 different diagnostics that we track within the battery system itself.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Superpedestrian, which recently lost a bid for New York City&#8217;s first e-scooter pilot to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot\/\">Bird, Lime and Veo<\/a>, has touted its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/19\/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades\/\">self-diagnostics software and in-house written OS<\/a> as one of its USPs for years. The company boasts that its LINK scooters, which are powered by its Vehicle Intelligent Safety (VIS) system, run 1,000 vehicle health checks every second a ride is taking place, checking for things like battery cell temperature imbalances, water penetration and brake issues.<\/p>\n<p>Bird&#8217;s batteries are encased in &#8220;hermetically sealed, tamper-proof, industry-leading IP68-rated protection to keep [them] safe from dust, water and theft,&#8221; according to the company, which also claims the battery on the Bird Three is the largest in the industry at 1kWh capacity. Superpedestrian, a company that shares Bird&#8217;s aversion to swappable batteries, has just about the same battery capacity at .986kWh, according to a spokesperson for the company. Lime, Bird&#8217;s biggest competitor, has gone the small, swappable battery route, and thus its battery capacity is .460kWh, according to a Lime spokesperson.<\/p>\n<p>Lime and other companies that use swappable batteries argue this strategy generates less emissions because the scooters can be serviced by gig economy workers on ebikes. Scooters have traditionally been rounded up, charged and then redistributed to public streets by gig economy workers driving around in gas-powered vans.<\/p>\n<p>With its latest scooter, Bird is doubling down on the big, static battery strategy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The battery is so big that we don&#8217;t really need to charge it very often, and it can go 15,000 to 20,000 miles before it has any type of serviceability event,&#8221; said Rushforth, who noted in major markets, Bird&#8217;s scooters are being charged roughly once a week. &#8220;We spend less time charging, less time rebalancing, less time going out and having to do maintenance and chase these vehicles around, which means we&#8217;re actually using less cars than you would generally when you have swappable batteries and have to go out all the time to swap them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So far it&#8217;s not clear which strategy is the most eco-friendly, but a sustainable scooter isn&#8217;t all about the battery. Rushforth says the Bird Three is designed to last 24 to 36 months on the street.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to make the most green vehicle in the world, and to accomplish that, the system needs to be extremely durable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As long as the vehicles last longer, we need less vehicles overall.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Because Bird Three is built on the same platform as Bird Two, many of the parts are the same which makes it easier to reduce, reuse and recycle at the end of the vehicle&#8217;s life. Once a battery reaches the end of its life, Bird turns to partners like ITAP to be responsibly recycled.<\/p>\n<p>Other updates on the Bird Three revolve around comfortability and safety, including a new braking system with front and rear brakes and an automatic emergency braking that detects a fault in the mechanical braking system and digitally stops the vehicle using the motor.<\/p>\n<p>Rushforth also noted that the vehicle ergonomics feel sturdier, with a longer wheelbase, wider handlebars and antimicrobial grips. The Bird Three has a new headlight and taillight that are globally certified so they can be used in places like Germany where scooters have more stringent requirements.

perhaps one of the most stressful things an adult can go through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competing with a bunch of people all putting offers on a house that fly off the market in a matter of days is not fun. One startup that is trying to give home buyers a competitive edge by giving them a way to offer all cash on a home has just raised a boatload of money to help it keep growing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homeward.com\">Homeward<\/a>, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which aims to help people buy homes faster, announced t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oday it has raised $136 million in a Series B funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners at a valuation \u201cjust north of $800 million.\u201d The company has also secured $235 million in debt.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstone, Breyer Capital and existing backers Adams Street, Javelin and LiveOak Venture Partners also participated in the equity financing, which brings Homeward\u2019s total equity raised since inception to $160 million.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeward\u2019s model seems to be appealing to both home buyers (including first time ones) and agents alike, with lots of growth occurring since May 2020 when it raised $105 million in debt and equity. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures but noted that its GMV (gross merchandise value) run rate is up over 600%+ year over year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, as of March, Homeward says it had experienced a 5x increase in the volume of homes transacted and 9x year over growth in the number of new customers. Plus, It\u2019s hired 161 employees since January alone, and currently has a headcount of 203, up from about 33 at this time last year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CEO Tim Heyl founded the real estate startup in late 2018 on the premise that in most cases, sellers prefer to receive all cash offers because they are more likely to close. Loans can fall through, but cash is cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heyl started the company after having worked in the industry for the previous decade, first as a broker then as the owner of a title company. During that time, he saw firsthand many of the problems in the industry. And one conundrum he frequently ran into was people not wanting to make an offer on a home without knowing for sure their current house would sell in a certain amount of time. This is a dilemma many are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic as demand outweighs supply in many major U.S. cities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe pandemic has greatly increased demand for our product,\u201d Heyl told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic seller\u2019s market with unprecedented demand from buyers and the lowest inventory levels in decades.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to use its new capital to \u201cdouble down\u201d on its offering, scale up to meet &#8220;outsized demand\u201d and open additional markets. Currently, Homeward operates in Texas, Colorado and Georgia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRight now, we have a waiting list in every market across the country, so this growth capital will enable us to meet that demand,\u201d Heyl said. Its ultimate goal is to open its offering to agents nationwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeward also plans to double the size of its title and mortgage teams in the latter half of the year so it can offer its clients and partner agents \u201ca single streamlined experience.\u201d It\u2019s also planning to integrate its consumer and internal software systems for approvals, offers and closing \u201cso everyone can be on a single platform and we can eliminate confusion and waste,\u201d Heyl added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how does it work exactly? Homeward will make an all-cash offer on behalf of a customer wanting to buy a house. Meanwhile, that customer can hire an agent (from brokerages such as Redfin or Keller Williams) to list their home with less pressure to sell it in a certain amount of time or at a discounted price. Once Homeward buys a home, it will lease the property back to its customer until they sell their house, get a mortgage, and can buy the property back from Homeward. During the process, Homeward offers a predetermined guaranteed price for its customer\u2019s home with the promise that if it\u2019s unable to sell the house for at least that amount, it\u2019ll buy the house from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The company charges the buyer a &#8220;standard convenience fee,&#8221; which varies by state and service. The buyer can get a closing credit when they use the company&#8217;s mortgage services.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heyl believes Homeward\u2019s \u201calternative iBuyer\u201d model is a better deal for customers since it doesn\u2019t purchase a customer\u2019s old home for below market value. The company also works with agents, and not against them, he said. For example, its offerings are available to any agent, but the company \u201cstrategically\u201d partners with top brokerages and teams, providing them with what it describes as \u201cdedicated support, white-label branding, and digital marketing tools to help them stand out from the crowd and attract more clients.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMost alternatives to traditional real estate minimize or replace the agent,\u201d Heyl said. \u201cBut we are agents ourselves, and we\u2019ve built this for agents.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeward is profitable on a per unit basis if you count transaction revenue minus costs to acquire and complete each transaction, according to Heyl.

Health<\/a> has closed a $90M Series B round of funding led by Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of the German multinational pharma giant, Bayer AG. Other investors in the round include Samsung Catalyst Fund, Vitruvian Partners, Inteligo Bank, F4 and Mutschler Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>The startup last raised around four years&#8217; ago, reporting a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/31\/berlins-ada-health-raises-47m-to-become-the-alexa-of-healthcare\/\">$47M Series A round in 2017<\/a>. But don&#8217;t be fooled by the low lettering of these rounds: Ada Health has been working on its symptom assessment tech for around a decade at this point &#8212; relying, in the first several years of its mission, on private funding from high net worth individuals in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tiFJws9lRy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/05\/move-slow-and-dont-break-things-how-to-build-an-ai-driven-startup\/\">Ada Health built an AI-driven startup by moving slowly and not breaking things<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ada Health built an AI-driven startup by moving slowly and not breaking things&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/05\/move-slow-and-dont-break-things-how-to-build-an-ai-driven-startup\/embed\/#?secret=tiFJws9lRy\" data-secret=\"tiFJws9lRy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Initially it was also focused on building a decision support tool for doctors before pivoting to directly addressing patients via an AI-driven symptom assessment app.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not alone in offering this type of tool. Others in the space include Babylon, Buoy, K Health, Mediktor, Symptomate, WebMD and Your.MD &#8212; but Ada claims its app is the most used and highest rated by users. It can also point to a <a href=\"https:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/10\/12\/e040269\">peer reviewed study<\/a> it led, which was published in the BMJ, and compared the condition coverage, accuracy and safety of eight competitors. The study found its app led the pack on all fronts.<\/p>\n<p>One reason for that edge is that Ada Health&#8217;s medical knowledge base covers around 30,000 ICD-10 codes (aka the alphanumeric codes used by doctors to represent different diagnoses) at this point &#8212; which co-founder and CEO, Daniel Nathrath, tells us is &#8220;by far the largest coverage of any of the systems in this space&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The Ada Health app, which launched in late 2016 &#8212; and remains free to use &#8212; has been downloaded by more than 11 million people across 150 countries so far. Users have completed some 23M assessments using the tool which he likens to having &#8220;24\/7 access to your trusted family doctor&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the app has support for 10 languages. But the goal with the funding is to push for truly massive scale.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea is to help as many people as possible get better access to healthcare around the world,&#8221; Nathrath tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our ambition is, in a few years, that a billion people instead of 11M people will be using out technology. In order to get there we think that working with the right investors can help us accelerate that growth path and give more people the benefit of our technology faster.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With 11M app downloads I believe we are the most used AI symptom assessment technology that I know of in the world,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;We are also the most rated and reviewed app in the medical category of the App Store and Google Play Store ever &#8212; after, what, just four years. With about 300,000 ratings and reviews, most of them five-star. So&#8230; we have gained some users but we think it&#8217;s just the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Digital health &#8212; with all the things you see going on &#8212; is at an inflection point where it&#8217;s being realized not only by the users who have already been using our technology but also by health systems, governments, and payers, insurers, and life sciences companies &#8212; I think everyone has realized digital health is here to stay.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As well as putting its symptom assessment app directly in the hands of patients, Ada Health offers a suite of enterprise solutions where partners pay it to be able to embed and deeply integrate its triage technology into their websites and digital services. That means they can use it to offer an entry point for their users &#8212; to help direct them to the correct service and provide administrative support by arming clinicians with health information provided by patient via the Ada interface (and the AI&#8217;s own assessment) ahead of the appointment.<\/p>\n<p>One publicly disclosed customer for Ada&#8217;s enterprise offering is Sutter Health, in the Bay Area.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They have integrated Ada into their own homepage and into their app so people can use it as a digital front door to the entire service of Sutter,&#8221; says Nathrath, explaining that the difference vs the version of the app that patients can download is &#8220;people don&#8217;t just get generic advice&#8221;. &#8220;It&#8217;s fully integrated. So if it says &#8212; for instance &#8212; you need to go to the emergency room&#8230; then you can go straight into appointment booking.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And not only that; when you book the appointment the outcome of the Ada pre-assessment can then be shared with the health professional who will then look at you so the doctor doesn&#8217;t start from a blank sheet of paper but is already pre-briefed and gets decision support in terms of &#8216;this is constellation of symptoms the patient is reporting&#8217; and &#8216;based on that these could be the most likely diagnosis and these should be the tests, examinations or investigations I should consider next to get to the confirmed diagnosis&#8217;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The added advantage for Ada&#8217;s enterprise partners is that patient data arrives with the doctor that sees them already structured so &#8212; after a few confirmations &#8212; they can easily import it into their documentation, saying precious minutes per patient, per Nathrath. &#8220;[If] you save a few minutes with each patient that means you have more time for the patients who really need you and not the patients who maybe has a cold and shows up in the emergency room, which unfortunately is a reality,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>With this enterprise strand of its business Ada is continuing to provide support for doctors. Nathrath suggests its patient-facing app is also being used for some informal decision support for doctors too.<\/p>\n<p>More and more doctors are using the app &#8220;together with their patients&#8221;, he tells us, or else recommending it to their patients &#8212;\u00a0 asking them &#8220;so what did Ada say?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The role of AI in healthcare will be a core one, Nathrath predicts &#8212; given that demand for healthcare professionals is always going to outstrip supply.<\/p>\n<p>He argues that&#8217;s true even with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/kry-closes-312m-series-d-after-use-of-its-telehealth-tools-surged-100-yoy\/\">rising use of telehealth platforms<\/a> which can certainly make more efficient use of doctors&#8217; time.<\/p>\n<p>Ada did, at one point, offer a telehealth service itself &#8212; before deciding to fully focus its efforts on AI &#8212; so its approach now is to partner and integrate with other healthcare and health data providers throughout the care ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a place for telehealth, obviously. It adds convenience. During the pandemic I guess it had a special role where for many it was almost the only way to interact with a doctor,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So we do see a place for telehealth but we also see an issue with telehealth in that it doesn&#8217;t address the structural issue in healthcare &#8212; that simply there aren&#8217;t enough doctors to serve the entire population of the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building Ada as a multi-sided platform,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be computing different sources of input data &#8212; which is sensor data, wearables data, lab data, genetic testing data &#8212; that&#8217;s on the input side &#8212; and then on the more downstream, on the next step after Ada, we can partner with any telehealth company in the world. And we&#8217;re seeing enormous interest from literally all corners of the world where telehealth companies approach us. And insurance companies and governments &#8212; where they say yes there is a use-case for telehealth but we basically need something before that, that filters people to the right next step.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Whatever that right next step is in a patient&#8217;s care journey, &#8220;Ada is like the gatekeeper at the beginning of the journey that then sends you on your way,&#8221; is how Nathrath puts it.<\/p>\n<p>The overarching vision is that Ada becomes not just an app in your pocket but an omnipresent &#8220;personal health companion&#8221; &#8212; or what it describes as &#8220;a personal operating system for health&#8221; &#8212; which is powerful enough to deliver preventative healthcare by being able to aggregate all sorts of data and spot health issues sooner so as to enable earlier and less costly interventions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is really much more than a symptom assessment technology,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Where you would also take into account lab results which can now be done much more direct to consumer than was previously possible, sensors and wearables data &#8212; and you probably say that Samsung is one of our investors but we&#8217;re obviously talking to all the large players in the space about this; how we can integrate that data best &#8212; and all the way to genetic testing and even the full genome sequence.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you take all these different sources of health information and compute them against each other on a continuous basis you&#8217;ll have something like an early warning system for your health &#8212; which, again, from a population health and system level perspective should be desirable for anyone who&#8217;s in charge of providing healthcare or paying for healthcare because you can catch the problem when it&#8217;s still a \u00a3100 problem and not yet a \u00a3100,000 a year problem.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Given that ambition it&#8217;s interesting that big pharma is investing in Ada. (And its PR notes that it&#8217;s also in talks with Bayer on a potential strategic partnership.) But Nathrath suggests that the industry is well aware of the shifts being driven by digital health &#8212; and keen to avoid its own &#8216;Kodak moment&#8217;, i.e. by not adapting to the coming changes in a timely enough manner.<\/p>\n<p>If AI-powered health interventions end up being so successful that they can shrink drug bills through earlier intervention and more preventative care then it makes good business sense for big pharma to be plugged into the cutting edge of digital health.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time this type of tech might end up driving demand for medicines &#8212; exactly because of its scalability and because it can present a higher dimension view of more people&#8217;s health &#8212; meaning there&#8217;s more opportunity for increased prescription. So there&#8217;s not really a downside for pharma to get involved here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited about the possibilities we can find by working together [with pharmaceutical companies] to really deliver a better healthcare experience to patients,&#8221; says Nathrath.\u00a0&#8220;If you look at Bayer they have a consumer health business, they also have a pharmaceutical business and if you look at the cases within Ada if you look at the top ten most common ones it&#8217;s very comparable to what a GP would see all the time and a lot of those basically can end up in the recommendation towards healthcare where oftentimes an over the counter drug will be enough to address the issue. One area where Bayer has a lot of offerings, of course. But then their spectrum goes all the way towards rare diseases &#8212; where we&#8217;re also particularly strong. Where they have some drugs that help patients with very rare conditions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are also potentially major research riches to be derived from the health data generated via Ada&#8217;s app which could also be interesting to pharma companies doing drug discovery.<\/p>\n<p>Although Nathrath emphasizes that app users&#8217; data is never used for research purpose without explicit consent from the individual (as is required under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Act).<\/p>\n<p>But he also notes that Ada is able to do some interesting studies based on aggregated user data, too &#8212; giving an example of how it looked at kids mental health during COVID-19 lockdowns, comparing areas where schools had been shut vs those where they had remained open. &#8220;You could really compare what happened in different countries,&#8221; he says, noting that rates of depression in kids in Germany where schools and pre-schools were closed went up by over 100%, whereas in Switzerland where schools remained opened throughout there was no rise and even a slight improvement in children&#8217;s mental health.<\/p>\n<p>In another example, involving aggregated data from usage of the app in US, he says it was able to show that it could have spotted a measles epidemic via the cases in the app slightly sooner than the CDC&#8217;s official announcement of an epidemic.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you think about the potential of that, in terms of spotting outbreaks earlier, that can be quite significant,&#8221; he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s really a long list of ways we can work together [with researchers, policymakers and pharma companies] for the benefit of patients,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;The mission of all the people I spoke to at Bayer was really similar to ours &#8212; which is to help people, basically&#8230; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re really happy to work with them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Dr. J\u00fcrgen Eckhardt, head of Leaps by Bayer, added: \u201cInvesting in breakthrough technologies that drive digital change in healthcare is one of the strategic imperatives for Leaps by Bayer and for the entire field of healthcare. Ada\u2019s truly transformative technology, combining powerful artificial intelligence with an emphasis on medical rigor and high levels of clinical accuracy will lead the way in helping more patients and consumers in achieving better health outcomes sooner by intervening earlier in their healthcare journey.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BvgN3a3vid\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/31\/berlins-ada-health-raises-47m-to-become-the-alexa-of-healthcare\/\">Berlin&#8217;s Ada\u00a0Health raises\u00a0$47M to become the Alexa of healthcare<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Berlin&#8217;s Ada\u00a0Health raises\u00a0$47M to become the Alexa of healthcare&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/31\/berlins-ada-health-raises-47m-to-become-the-alexa-of-healthcare\/embed\/#?secret=BvgN3a3vid\" data-secret=\"BvgN3a3vid\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7yRci36FLo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/kry-closes-312m-series-d-after-use-of-its-telehealth-tools-surged-100-yoy\/\">Kry closes $312M Series D after use of its telehealth tools grows 100% yoy<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kry closes $312M Series D after use of its telehealth tools grows 100% yoy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/kry-closes-312m-series-d-after-use-of-its-telehealth-tools-surged-100-yoy\/embed\/#?secret=7yRci36FLo\" data-secret=\"7yRci36FLo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wTCPWRiJUe\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/28\/kaia-health-grabs-75m-on-surging-interest-in-its-virtual-therapies-for-chronic-pain-and-copd\/\">Kaia Health grabs $75M on surging interest in its virtual therapies for chronic pain and COPD<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kaia Health grabs $75M on surging interest in its virtual therapies for chronic pain and COPD&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/28\/kaia-health-grabs-75m-on-surging-interest-in-its-virtual-therapies-for-chronic-pain-and-copd\/embed\/#?secret=wTCPWRiJUe\" data-secret=\"wTCPWRiJUe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The digital health space continues cooking on gas: Berlin-based Ada Health has closed a $90M Series B round of funding led by Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of the German multinational pharma giant, Bayer AG.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wayflyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a revenue-based financing platform for e-commerce merchants, has raised $76 million in a Series A funding round led by Left Lane Capital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPartners\u201d of DST Global, QED Investors, Speedinvest<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Zinal Growth &#8212; the family office of Guillaume Pousaz (founder of<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checkout.com<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; also put money in the round. The raise comes just after Wayflyer raised $100 million in debt funding to support its cash advance product, and 14 months after the Dublin, Ireland-based startup launched its first product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an e-commerce boom fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wayflyer is the latest in a group of startups focused on the space that has attracted investor interest as of late. The company aims to help e-commerce merchants \u201cunlock growth\u201d by giving them access to working capital (from $10,000 up to $20 million) so they can improve cash flow and drive sales. For example, more cash can help these merchants do things like buy more inventory in bulk so they can meet customer demand and save money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In a nutshell, Wayflyer uses analytics and sends merchants cash to make inventory purchases or investments in their business. Those merchants then repay Wayflyer using a percentage of their revenue until the money is paid back (plus a fee charged for the cash advance). So essentially, the merchants are using their revenue to get financing, hence the term revenue-based financing. The advantage, Wayflyer says, is that companies make repayments as a percentage of their sales. So if they have a slow month, they will pay back less. So, there&#8217;s more flexibility involved than with other mechanisms such as traditional bank loans.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LJjuSbMyrh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/22\/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021\/\">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/22\/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021\/embed\/#?secret=LJjuSbMyrh\" data-secret=\"LJjuSbMyrh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-founder Aidan Corbett believes that in a crowded space, Wayflyer\u2019s use of big data gives it an edge over competitors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corbett and former VC Jack Pierse spun Wayflyer out of a marketing analytics company that Corbett had also started, called Conjura, in September 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJack came to me and said, \u2018You should stop using our marketing analytics engine to do these big enterprise SaaS solutions, and instead use them to underwrite e-commerce businesses for short-term finance,\u2019 \u201d Corbett recalls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so he did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe just had our heads down and started repurposing the platform for it to be an underwriting platform,\u201d Corbett said. It launched in April 2020, doing about $600,000 in advances at the time. In March of 2021, Wayflyer did about $36 million in advances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSo, it&#8217;s been a pretty aggressive kind of growth,\u201d Corbett said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past six months alone, the company has seen its business grow 290% as it has deployed over $150 million of funding across 10 markets with a focus on the U.S., the United Kingdom and Australia. About 75% of its customers are U.S. based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wayflyer plans to use its new capital toward product development and global expansion with the goal of entering \u201cmultiple\u201d new markets in the coming months. The company recently opened a sales office in Atlanta, and also has locations in\u00a0the U.K., the Netherlands and Spain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Corbett, the company\u2019s offering is more compelling than buy now, pay later solutions for consumers for example, in that it is funding the merchant directly and able to add services on top of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere&#8217;s a lot more opportunity for companies like ourselves to differentiate because essentially, we focus on the merchants. And when we underwrite the merchant by getting data from the merchant, there&#8217;s a lot of additional services that you can put in on top,\u201d Corbett explained. \u201cWhereas with buy now, pay later, you get information on the consumer, and there&#8217;s not as much room to add additional services on top.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a business requests an advance and either is not approved for one, or doesn\u2019t choose to take it, Wayflyer\u2019s analytics platform is free to anybody who signs up to help them optimize their marketing spend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis is a critical driver of value for e-commerce businesses. If you can&#8217;t acquire customers at a reasonable price, you&#8217;re not going to be around very long. And a lot of early-stage e-commerce businesses struggle with that,\u201d Corbett said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also can pair up a merchant with a marketing analytics &#8220;specialist\u201d to analyze its marketing performance or an inventory &#8220;specialist&#8221; to look at the current terms and price a business is getting from a supplier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur focus from the very beginning is really supporting the merchants, not just providing them with working capital,\u201d Corbett said.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way the company claims to be different is in how it deploys funds. As mentioned above, merchants can pay the money back at varied terms, depending on how sales are going. The company makes money by charging a principal on advances, and then a \u201cremittance rate\u201d on revenues until the total amount is paid back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe tend to be more flexible than competition in this way,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cAlso, some competitors will pay invoices on merchants\u2019 behalf or give them a pre-charged card to use on advertising spend,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cWe always give cash into a merchant\u2019s account.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wayflyer recently inked an agreement with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wayflyer.com\/blog\">Adobe Commerce<\/a>, a partnership it said would provide a new channel to further amplify its growth with the goal of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funding 8,000 e-commerce businesses in the first year of the partnership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For his part, Left Lane Capital Partner <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Ahrens said that his firm was impressed by Wayflyer\u2019s \u201cnuanced understanding of what will drive value for their clients.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe team\u2019s focus, specialization, and deep analytical expertise within the e-commerce market also drives superior underwriting,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cTheir explosive growth has not come about by taking on undue risk. We are big believers that their underwriting will only improve with scale, and that Wayflyer will be able to compound its competitive advantages over time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As mentioned, this is an increasingly crowded space.

says concerned with India intimidation, requests 3 more months to comply with new IT rules"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Twitter called the recent visit by police to its Indian offices a form of intimidation and said it was concerned by some of the requirements in New Delhi\u2019s new IT rules.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking for the first time since a special squad of Delhi police <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label\/\">made a surprise visit to two of its offices<\/a> on Monday, Twitter said it is \u201cconcerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company also said that it joins many organizations in India and around the world that have \u201cconcerns with regards to the use of intimidation tactics by the police in response to enforcement of our global Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT Rules.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>A Twitter spokesperson added: \u201cWe plan to advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian Government and believe it is critical to adopt a collaborative approach. It is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry, and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tension between American tech giants Twitter and Facebook and the Indian government has been brewing for months. Twitter faced heat from politicians after it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/09\/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning\/\">refused to block accounts<\/a> that criticised New Delhi\u2019s reforms and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.<\/p>\n<p>India is one of the largest markets for American tech firms that poured billions of dollars in the South Asian nation in the past decade to get more people connected to the web. According to Indian government estimates, Twitter has 175 million users in India, while WhatsApp has amassed over 530 million users.<\/p>\n<p>Their tension escalated Wednesday after WhatsApp <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/whatsapp-sues-india-government\/\">sued the Indian government<\/a> in a court in Delhi over the new IT rules that it said would compromise users\u2019 privacy and give New Delhi the power to conduct mass surveillance.<\/p>\n<p>India announced the new IT rules in February and gave firms three months to comply. The deadline expired this week, and on Wednesday the Ministry of Electronics and IT <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/india-asks-social-media-firms-if-they-have-complied-with-the-new-regulations\/\">asked social media firms for an update on their compliant status<\/a>, TechCrunch first reported.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter said Thursday that the new IT rules\u2019 requirements to make a compliance officer criminally liable for content on the platform, proactive monitoring, and blanket authority to seek information about users represented a dangerous overreach that was inconsistent with open and democratic principles.<\/p>\n<p>The microblogging platform also requested New Delhi to consider granting a minimum of 3 months extension to comply with the new IT rules and publish Standard Operating Protocols on aspects of compliance of public consultation.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter said it was recently served with another non-compliance notice in India and withheld a portion of the content identified in the notice under. The content identified in the notice, Twitter said, was originally reported in the blocking orders since February 2021.<\/p>\n<p>It said in recent months it has been compelled to withhold content in response to a non-compliance notice. Not doing so, it said, poses penal consequences with many risks for Twitter employees.<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company is committed to complying with the new IT rules. &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously early days and our local teams are very engaged. You know we comply with local laws and we will approach it with the same framework,&#8221; he said in a briefing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We engage and explain to everyone the importance of information, promoting free flow of information, but we do want to respect legislative processes in democratic countries. We are committed to complying,&#8221; he said, adding that the company will highlight any requests it complies with in its transparency reports.<\/p>\n<p>India&#8217;s response to Twitter&#8217;s statement today:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Press Release by Ministry of Electronics and IT in response to the statements made by Twitter Inc. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/hQxCGuoEaG\">pic.twitter.com\/hQxCGuoEaG<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Ministry of Electronics &amp; IT (@GoI_MeitY) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GoI_MeitY\/status\/1397895486904836096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KIbpENoURR\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/india-says-whatsapps-lawsuit-over-new-regulations-a-clear-act-of-defiance\/\">India says WhatsApp&#8217;s lawsuit over new regulations a clear act of defiance<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;India says WhatsApp&#8217;s lawsuit over new regulations a clear act of defiance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/india-says-whatsapps-lawsuit-over-new-regulations-a-clear-act-of-defiance\/embed\/#?secret=KIbpENoURR\" data-secret=\"KIbpENoURR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter called the recent visit by police to its Indian offices a form of intimidation and said it was concerned by some of the requirements in New Delhi\u2019s new IT rules.

Growing up in India, she thought she might be in the business of running a factory, given the power and influence of outfits like Tata Group, the Indian multinational conglomerate.<\/p>\n<p>She certainly had an affinity for school, graduating at the top of her high school class, nabbing a mechanical engineering degree in India and more recently landing at Stanford&#8217;s business school. Except that instead of create the more traditional business she once had in mind, Madhavan found herself tinkering with an entirely different idea: a matchmaking app called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schmoozedating.com\/\">Schmooze<\/a> that combines machine learning and memes to connect people based on what Madhavan calls a humor algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>The idea dates back several years when, as an analyst with McKinsey in India who was debating whether or not to attend grad school in California, Madhavan cold-emailed 10 people on LinkedIn who had attended U.S. business schools for advice. Only one of them replied, but over the next couple of days, she says, &#8220;we exchanged, like, 200 emails, all of them fundamentally jokes.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Reader, she is now married to that person. Indeed, she says it&#8217;s because she believes their shared sense of humor brought them together that she began tinkering with the idea of Schmooze, initially as a way to foster new friendships. It was when she saw the way things were trending &#8212; people were really looking for a love match &#8212; that she refocused the idea as a dating app for Gen Z users who already communicate largely with memes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FvrIfdjerY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/10\/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors\/\">Snack, a &#8216;Tinder meets TikTok&#8217; dating app, opens to Gen Z investors<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Snack, a &#8216;Tinder meets TikTok&#8217; dating app, opens to Gen Z investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/10\/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors\/embed\/#?secret=FvrIfdjerY\" data-secret=\"FvrIfdjerY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It has been taking off since, says Madhavan. Though it hasn&#8217;t yet spread Facebook-like across college campuses, a beta test in late summer with 200 Stanford students has since led to more than 10,000 downloads around the country, where people are swiping right &#8212; or left &#8212; to more than 5,000 memes that are culled entirely by still-in-beta Schmooze (until it&#8217;s big enough to deal with content moderation).<\/p>\n<p>Currently about 200 memes are added each day, while others are deleted. &#8220;No one cares about the U.S. elections anymore,&#8221; Madhavan notes.<\/p>\n<p>Using tagging and machine learning, combined with the bios that users create for themselves, Schmooze gets to work. Some users might show a predilection for particular topics, for example, like physics or finance. Some who say they&#8217;re interested in entrepreneurship might reveal an even stronger passion for music through their choices. There are similar divides when it comes to dark humor, and people who really love puns &#8212; and those who hate them.<\/p>\n<p>Whether the algorithm truly works will take time, and lasting unions, to know. Madhavan says that 90,000 matches have been made to date, but naturally, a far smaller number have moved from matched to in-app messaging.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ERZ4l4H38j\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/15\/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes\/\">Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/15\/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes\/embed\/#?secret=ERZ4l4H38j\" data-secret=\"ERZ4l4H38j\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Schmooze has plenty of competition in the meantime, both from traditional dating platforms and from newer apps and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/05\/19\/style\/marriage-pact-college-stanford.html\">questionnaires<\/a> that try pairing people based on share interests rather than <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/15\/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes\/\">looks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also easy to imagine more meme-based dating apps suddenly springing into existence, particularly given today&#8217;s go-go market.

And since launching in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/paired\/\">October<\/a>, with $1M to kick things off, they&#8217;ve convinced 5,000+ coupled-up others to try their custom blend of partner quizzes, &#8220;relationship satisfaction&#8221; tracking, and audio tips from experts &#8212; to try to feel closer to their S.O.<\/p>\n<p>Paired is now gunning for serious growth: It&#8217;s announcing $3.6M in seed funding today, led by Eka Ventures with participation from existing investors including Taavet Hinrikus (Wise, formerly TransferWise), Harold Primat (investor and former professional racing driver), and the co-founders of Runtastic.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the seed funding, Camilla Dolan of Eka Ventures will join the board alongside the app\u2019s co-founders Kevin Shanahan and Diego L\u00f3pez (who previously worked together at language learning app <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/11\/memrise-raises-15-5m-as-its-ai-based-language-learning-app-passes-35m-users\/\">Memrise<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Paired says its goal for the new funding is to grow its user-base from 5,000+ to 100k over the next 18 months.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8UZsVqU9uZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/paired\/\">Paired picks up $1M funding and launches its relationship app for couples<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Paired picks up $1M funding and launches its relationship app for couples&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/paired\/embed\/#?secret=8UZsVqU9uZ\" data-secret=\"8UZsVqU9uZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>All sorts of audio-led <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/10\/quilt-an-audio-social-network-focused-on-self-care-raises-3-5-million-in-seed\/\">wellness &#8216;self-care&#8217; apps<\/a> have been bubbling up in recent years &#8212; offering individuals app-wrapped help with stuff like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/20\/audible-gets-guided-meditation-and-workouts-courtesy-of-aaptiv\/\">meditation<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/06\/22\/simple-habit-is-an-app-to-squeeze-mindfulness-into-your-busy-day\/\">mindfulness<\/a>; targeted motivation to combat <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/02\/shine-brings-its-female-focused-self-care-app-to-android\/\">anxiety<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/endel-series-a\/\">stress<\/a>; or\u00a0dishing up <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/14\/lover-sex-help\/\">sex tips<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/emjoy-picks-up-3m-to-get-more-women-tuned-into-sexual-self-care\/\">sexual self awareness<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Paired fits within that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/02\/self-care-apps-are-booming\/\">broader trend<\/a>, albeit with a more explicit nudge to extend the self-care phenomenon to a unit of two romantically connected people.<\/p>\n<p>As it looks for growth, the UK-based startup says it will continue to target the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, which are its main markets at this point. &#8220;We expect the growth to continue to come from here over the next 12 months,&#8221; says Shanahan.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building out our product team &#8212; hiring engineers, a product manager, a data scientist &#8212; to begin offering more varied and personalised relationship conversations for our users,&#8221; he goes on.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Personalisation is a particular focus as every relationship is different and the app will begin to understand what your interests are, what stage you&#8217;re in, what would be most useful for you to discuss, etc. We&#8217;re also growing our content, working with new experts to cover more relationship topics and marketing the app via influencers, partnerships, and other channels.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Who are Paired&#8217;s early adopters? Currently, the average user is a straight, early 30s Millennial who&#8217;s been in their current relationship for two-three years, according to Shanahan. (He says around 5% of users are LGBTQ+.)<\/p>\n<p>But he also claims Paired has a wide mix of users, adding: &#8220;We have couples who have been together for 6 months and those who have been together for 10+ years, so it&#8217;s a wide spectrum.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He says the split of women and men using the app is &#8220;fairly even&#8221; but avoids specifying exactly how usage splits on gender lines.<\/p>\n<p>The app can be used by only one half of a couple &#8212; for solo relationship support\/self-care, if preferred &#8212; but users have the option to pair with their partner to swap answers to relationship questions in order to encourage discussion. And that&#8217;s where Paired can offer the most personalized experience to users, by opening up a dedicated &#8216;relationship&#8217; discussion channel between the couple. (Paired does not obviously cater to open\/polyamorous couples &#8212; but presumably could be used as a discussion tool for the primary partners.)<\/p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2156320,2156321,2156322,2156324,2156325,2156327,2156329\"]<\/p>\n<p>The idea isn&#8217;t to replace couples therapy, per Shanahan. Rather Paired wants to create a whole new intermediating layer &#8212; based on the notion that communication problems in a relationship can be tackled earlier (and more easily) if you stick a piece of software between you which nudges both halves of the relationship to notice and address potential disconnect.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If couples therapy is a dentist for your relationship, then we would be a toothbrush,&#8221; is how Shanahan puts it when asked if the idea is to replace couples therapy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Like a toothbrush is not a substitute for the dentist, we aren\u2019t trying to replace couples therapy. Our goal is to promote healthy relationship behaviours between couples and believe our audience will eventually grow to become the majority of couples,&#8221; he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>He points to a study Paired commissioned from the Open University and University of Brighton &#8212; which he says showed that couples who used the app over the course of three months saw on average a 36% increase in their &#8220;relationship satisfaction&#8221;. (Albeit quantifying such a subjective measure as a percentile increase may not appeal to every romantic person&#8217;s tastes.)<\/p>\n<p>Shanahan says Paired wants to offer ongoing support, too &#8212; rather than (the opposite scenario) of its users arriving at such a point of mutual understanding they could feel they don&#8217;t never need to take another partner quiz to understand what their life partner is thinking\/feeling.<\/p>\n<p>Its philosophy is, no matter how thoughtful you get vis-a-vis your S.O., there&#8217;s always more to learn and thus you always need to keep working on &#8216;relationship care&#8217;. It is of course a very convenient philosophy for a subscription app.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You probably wouldn&#8217;t say success when you&#8217;re fit is to stop going to the gym,&#8221; says Shanahan. &#8220;Or when your teeth are healthy to stop brushing your teeth. Similarly we want Paired to be a tool to help keep your relationship in a good place, so success for us is keeping your relationship satisfaction high over time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So what have the founders learned about their own relationships from using Paired?<\/p>\n<p>Shanahan confirms that he and his partner have been using the app &#8220;a ton (and not just for testing)&#8221;, adding: &#8220;I&#8217;ve personally learnt that there is always more to discover about your partner and it\u2019s a fun journey. Also that discussing issues when they are small is useful so they don&#8217;t become big later down the line.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Diego L\u00f3pez, Paired&#8217;s other co-founder and CTO, tells us that the daily questions posed by the app have &#8220;helped my partner and I fight lockdown monotony&#8221;. &#8220;There\u2019s been many occasions where we give the same answer to a question. It\u2019s a great feeling to know that we understand each other and a reminder of the things we have in common,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Commenting on Paired&#8217;s seed round in a statement, Camilla Dolan from Eka Ventures, said: \u201cDespite relationship health being such an important and truly global part of our lives there is not currently an accessible and affordable way of supporting it &#8212; <span class=\"il\">Paired<\/span> has set out to change that.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;We love Kevin &amp; Diego&#8217;s vision to bring happiness and health to relationships and be the global category leader for relationship management. What really got us excited though was the <span class=\"il\">Paired<\/span> user stories and the level of change that <span class=\"il\">Paired<\/span> is already having on their early users.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In another supporting statement, existing investor Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of Wise, added: \u201cKevin and the <span class=\"il\">Paired<\/span> team have a vision for improving the relationships of hundreds of millions of couples. Building and strengthening relationships is something we all need help with from time to time, but lots of people feel unsure of where to turn for help. The rapid uptake from paid subscribers since their October launch makes me confident that it can become the global, digital platform for relationships.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Paired&#8217;s app (available on <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/gb\/app\/id1469609343?ls=1\">iOS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.getpaired.app\">Google Play<\/a>) is free to download &#8212; but a monthly or yearly subscription is required to access the full range of content and support.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2XqRXcgR2h\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/02\/self-care-apps-are-booming\/\">Self-care apps are booming<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Self-care apps are booming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/02\/self-care-apps-are-booming\/embed\/#?secret=2XqRXcgR2h\" data-secret=\"2XqRXcgR2h\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sbpSayLFkB\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/10\/quilt-an-audio-social-network-focused-on-self-care-raises-3-5-million-in-seed\/\">Quilt, an audio social network focused on self care, raises $3.5 million in seed<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Quilt, an audio social network focused on self care, raises $3.5 million in seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/10\/quilt-an-audio-social-network-focused-on-self-care-raises-3-5-million-in-seed\/embed\/#?secret=sbpSayLFkB\" data-secret=\"sbpSayLFkB\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6moePB8CA6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/14\/lover-sex-help\/\">Tinder founder funds sex tips app Lover<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tinder founder funds sex tips app Lover&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/14\/lover-sex-help\/embed\/#?secret=6moePB8CA6\" data-secret=\"6moePB8CA6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IMHVa1qI0F\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/02\/shine-brings-its-female-focused-self-care-app-to-android\/\">Shine brings its female-focused self-care app to Android<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Shine brings its female-focused self-care app to Android&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/02\/shine-brings-its-female-focused-self-care-app-to-android\/embed\/#?secret=IMHVa1qI0F\" data-secret=\"IMHVa1qI0F\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can an app improve your romantic relationships?

million funding round led by Greenoaks. With today\u2019s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $500 million (\u20ac415 million). Agicap is building a service that lets you track your cash flow in real time, build reports and get forecasts.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Greenoaks, existing investors BlackFin Capital Partners and Partech are also participating in the round. It represents a big jump from last year\u2019s $18 million Series A round.<\/p>\n<p>The basic premise of Agicap is quite simple. Many small companies rely on Microsoft Excel to figure out their cash position every week or every month. Instead of exporting .csv files from your bank accounts, you can connect your bank accounts to Agicap for real-time monitoring. Similarly, Agicap has developed integrations with accounting software and invoicing tools.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When you want to see how you\u2019re doing when it comes to cash, you can connect to your Agicap account just like you\u2019d connect to a web analytics service. Agicap tries to break down how much you\u2019re spending by category and branch. After that, you can run projections and make decisions based on forecasts.<\/p>\n<p>Designed specifically for small and medium companies, Agicap has managed to convince 3,500 companies to use its service. They pay a monthly subscription fee. Clients include Cityscoot, Meero, Merci Handy, Ornikar and Blend Burger.<\/p>\n<p>Agicap is currently live in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. France still generates 50% of the company\u2019s revenue but other markets are growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis Series B comes at a key moment in our development,\u201d co-founder and CEO S\u00e9bastien Beyet said in a statement. \u201cIt demonstrates our will to make Agicap the European leader in our market and will allow us to further accelerate our international presence, launching in 10 new countries in the coming months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Following today\u2019s funding round, the company has some ambitious expansion plans. The company\u2019s team has already grown from 30 employees to 200 employees over the last 12 months. Now, it plans to build a team of 1,000 employees within the next couple of years.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup Agicap has raised a new $100 million funding round led by Greenoaks.

showed off the final version of its all-electric Air sedan, the company has finally revealed the in-cabin tech \u2014 from the curved 34-inch display and second touchscreen to the underlying software, integrated apps and Amazon Alexa voice assistant \u2014 that drivers and passengers will use once the automaker begins deliveries of the vehicle in the second half of the year.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the company&#8217;s branded Lucid User Experience, or Lucid UX, is to include all the tech that customers might want in a vehicle priced between $80,000 and $169,000 without adding clutter and confusion.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We really tried to follow a strong principle of ease-of-use and a short learning curve, for it to have quick responses and an overall feeling of elegance,&#8221; Derek Jenkins, Lucid&#8217;s head of design said in a recent interview. &#8220;I kind of wanted to move away from it being overly technical or sci-fi looking or spreadsheet-like and really move towards something that was more fitting with the brand and our design ethos.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The interior isn&#8217;t as stark as a Tesla Model 3 or Tesla Model Y, nor as jam-packed as some of the German luxury vehicles. Jenkins and his team have tried to hit the Goldilocks&#8217;s equivalent the perfect bowl of tech porridge.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At the beginning of the project I always used to tell the team, &#8216;Listen I want my mom to be able to get in this car and figure it out the first time,&#8217; &#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;She should be able to know instinctively probably the light switch and the door locks are on the left side because that&#8217;s where they always are and not have to dig through that stuff. Or that the climate controls are probably on the lower screen because that&#8217;s where it often is and traditionally has been. I just felt like it should have intuitiveness and a degree of simplicity, while still having impressive features and having a system that can grow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158000\" style=\"width: 3850px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158000\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2158000 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg\" alt=\"Lucid Motors interior cabin\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-11.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lucid Motors<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>The hardware<\/h2>\n<p>The curved 34-inch 5K display called the glass cockpit floats slightly above the dashboard and is the most visible hardware in the vehicle, although is not the only component worth mentioning.

The driver or passenger can swipe menus from the home screen down to the pilot panel to display in-depth controls for music or navigation. And if the driver doesn&#8217;t want that additional touchscreen, the pilot panel can be retracted, opening access to a storage space behind it.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that analog switches are still within the vehicle in three areas: the doors, the steering wheel and a slice of space between the pilot panel and the upper home screen. Alongside the doors, the driver or passengers will find the window switches and interior door latches. Right above the center console display are four physical buttons that lets the driver or passenger control climate temperature and fan speed.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158057\" style=\"width: 3850px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158057\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2158057 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Lucid_User_Experience_Reveal-07.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158057\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lucid Motors<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the steering wheel is a touch bar and two toggles. These buttons can be used to launch the Alexa voice assistant and turn on and off the advanced driver assistance functions, as well as adjust the following distance in cruise control and volume.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We did a lot of research through this discussion of analog interaction such as physical buttons and digital interaction on a touchscreen,&#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;What we found was there was some key functionality that people still wanted to have physical interaction with.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The vehicle is also loaded with 32 sensors, including a single lidar that is located just below the nose blade on the exterior of the vehicle. Below that is a lower air intake and then a forward-facing radar. Other radar sensors are located on the exterior corners. There are exterior cameras, as well, in the nose and header area behind the rearview mirror.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the vehicle, and tucked right below the instrument cluster, is a camera that faces the driver. This camera is part of the driver-monitoring system, which is meant to ensure the operator is paying attention when the advanced driver assistance system is engaged.<\/p>\n<p>Two other hardware items worth noting are the 21-speaker surround sound system from Dolby Atmos and a small vintage (and Miata-esque) detail with the air vents. Lucid wanted the Air to have physical air vents that a person could touch and move &#8212; unlike the Tesla Model 3, which requires the user to move the direction of the air flow through the digital touchscreen. But Lucid didn&#8217;t want the bulk of a vent in the chiclet-style design, which has an additional side tab to turn on or off the air flow.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is a slimmed-down air vent with a single round dial right in the middle. That dial can be grabbed and moved to shift air flow. It also can be turned to shut off the air to a particular vent.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a breakthrough for us,&#8221; Jenkins said laughing, &#8220;which isn&#8217;t a breakthrough because that was super common in the 60s and 70s in cars.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The software<\/h2>\n<p>Behind all of the physical touchscreens and sensors is the software that delivers functions and services.<\/p>\n<p>Lucid started with the open-source Android Automotive operating system and built out the apps and other features from there. Android Automotive OS is modeled after Google&#8217;s Android open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. Google has offered an open-source version of this OS to automakers for some time. In recent years, automakers have worked with Google to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store. Lucid did not take the Google services platform route.<\/p>\n<p>From here, Lucid worked with various third-party apps and integrated them into the infotainment system, a list that currently includes\u00a0iHeartRadio, TuneIn, Pocket Casts, Dolby Atmos, Tidal and Spotify.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7iXdOxIviF\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit\/\">Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit\/embed\/#?secret=7iXdOxIviF\" data-secret=\"7iXdOxIviF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Lucid has also decided to make Alexa the default and primary integrated voice control system. Lucid Air will also come with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \u2014 apps that run on the user\u2019s phone and wirelessly communicate with the vehicle\u2019s infotainment system. This means the driver, or passenger, can access Google Assistant and Siri through these apps, they just won&#8217;t be able to control the vehicle functions like climate.<\/p>\n<p>The vehicle will also have integrated mobile and Wi-Fi connectivity, which will allow Lucid to update the software of the vehicle wirelessly. The over-the-air update capability lets the company add new apps and services.<\/p>\n<h2>The future<\/h2>\n<p>Jenkins said they&#8217;re already looking at bringing more content to the infotainment system, including gaming and video streaming, which would only be accessible when the vehicle is parked.<\/p>\n<p>The Lucid design team is also examining other more hardware-based additions to future model years of the Air, including rear entertainment displays.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You probably won&#8217;t see that from us until sometime in 2023,&#8221; Jenkins noted. &#8220;We think that&#8217;s an important thing to bring to the car especially because the rear seat is such a nice place to be.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"

Its studio purchase helps cement Amazon in the mix of tech companies with huge investments in the online video space. Observers believe the e-commerce giant plans to use MGM to bolster its Prime service, making consumers less likely to churn thanks to the inclusion of more services. Which rings hollow to us: Who is going to give up Prime, but be swayed by movies? The connection to shipping speed feels tenuous.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The global fintech boom:<\/strong> This morning, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/latam-focused-corporate-spend-startup-clara-raises-30m-months-after-its-last-round\/\">Clara announced a new round<\/a><\/strong>, mere months after it raised <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/10\/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth\/\">its preceding round of capital<\/a><\/strong>. The Mexican startup works in the corporate spend market, a startup niche that recently saw a $2.5 billion exit in the United States, and more capital for<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/08\/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation\/\"> both Ramp<\/a><\/strong> and Brex. Our read here is that many nascent fintech formulas that work in the U.S. are going to have wide remit globally.<\/li>\n<li><strong>IPOs are back:<\/strong> The recent Flywire IPO pricing (strong) and first-day trading (even stronger) are indicative that <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/flywires-flotation-suggests-the-ipo-slowdown-is-behind-us\/\">the temporarily slowed public-offering market is <em>back<\/em><\/a><\/strong>. So, Robinhood, let\u2019s go?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Startups and VC<\/h2>\n<p>Here are five of the tastiest venture capital rounds that TechCrunch covered, showing off an array of niches and round sizes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/uks-paysend-raises-125m-at-a-700m-valuation-to-expand-its-all-in-one-payments-platform\/\"><strong>UK\u2019s Paysend raises $125M for mobile B2B payments<\/strong><\/a><strong>:<\/strong> You are excused for wondering if every fintech round these days involves both companies and payments. I feel the same way. But what matters in the case of Paysend is that its model to provide SMB online payment services is happening from a post-Brexit U.K. Not even a tectonic decoupling can stop U.K. fintech, it seems.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/yalo-raises-50m-to-build-c-commerce-services-for-chat-apps-like-whatsapp\/\"><strong>Yalo raises $50M for conversational commerce<\/strong><\/a><strong>:<\/strong> Here\u2019s a tech startup round that typifies the year. Did it raise less than a year ago? Yes. Did the company have funding find it, as opposed to the other way around? Yes. And did COVID accelerate its business? Yes. Yalo is a wager that the way we buy online is changing, a technology story if we\u2019ve ever heard of one. And it\u2019s one that venture capitalists are lining up to bet on.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed\/\"><strong>Skiff raises $3.7M for encrypted Google Docs<\/strong><\/a><strong>: <\/strong>That\u2019s the pitch, per our own Zack Whittaker. Essentially, Skiff mimics the familiar features of Google Docs, but with end-to-end encryption. As a fan of privacy, I dig the project.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/treet-with-2-8-million-in-seed-funding-gets-brands-involved-in-the-resale-market\/\"><strong>Treet raises $2.8M to help brands resell their own stuff<\/strong><\/a><strong>: <\/strong>The online resale market is huge. ThreadUp is public now, as is Poshmark. But Treet is betting that there is still room in the market for more tech, namely its plan to get brands involved in their own resale market. It isn\u2019t the richest startup around, but given the sheer number of brands out there, it has a pretty huge TAM to grow into.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation\/\">African fintech OPay is in the process of raising a huge new round<\/a>.

That&#8217;s a question Twitter will soon answer when it rolls out a new subscription service that will present users with an expanded feature set available only to paid subscribers. This is a different offering than Twitter&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon\/\">previously announced Super Follow subscription<\/a> plans, which will allow users to subscribe to individual creators for access to exclusive content. Instead, the new subscription service will target Twitter&#8217;s power users who tweet frequently enough or otherwise engage with the product to the point that they&#8217;d be willing to pay to do even more.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has already broadly hinted at its forthcoming subscription plans, having told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-08\/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content?sref=gni836kR\">Bloomberg in February<\/a> that it would &#8220;research and experiment&#8221; with ways to diversify its revenue beyond advertising in 2021 and beyond. Twitter ads are 85% of revenue, but Twitter often faces <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-09\/twitter-beats-revenue-estimates-warns-of-slowing-user-growth\">slowing<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/news\/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows\/588093\/\">flat<\/a> user growth. That has led the company to consider new ways to extract more money from existing users. It told Bloomberg this plan &#8220;may include subscriptions&#8221; and other approaches that gave businesses and users access to &#8220;unique features.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It also reiterated its interest in subscription products<a href=\"https:\/\/s22.q4cdn.com\/826641620\/files\/doc_downloads\/2021\/02\/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf\"> during its Twitter Analyst Day<\/a> later that same month, when it said it would &#8220;experiment with subscriptions.&#8221; And its Twitter Investor Relations account <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterIR\/status\/1366821636712722432\">tweeted in March<\/a> that it would &#8220;test subscription products in public.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But so far, the only subscription product Twitter has fully detailed is Super Follow, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon\/\">also announced during its Analyst Day event.<\/a> It had not specifically spelled out what its other subscription tests would look like, nor provided any sense as to when they would arrive beyond tests that would begin rolling out <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterIR\/status\/1366821636712722432\">&#8220;over the course of this year<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qz3OftytSG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon\/\">Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;Super Follow&#8217; creator subscription takes shots at Substack and Patreon<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;Super Follow&#8217; creator subscription takes shots at Substack and Patreon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon\/embed\/#?secret=qz3OftytSG\" data-secret=\"qz3OftytSG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>What we know of Twitter&#8217;s efforts on this particular front doesn&#8217;t come from official sources.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, it comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wongmjane\/status\/1393541248049303555\">app researcher Jane Manchun Wong<\/a>, who earlier this month scooped not only Twitter&#8217;s premium subscription offering itself but also its name and pricing. She found the forthcoming subscription plan, currently dubbed &#8220;Twitter Blue,&#8221; would cost $2.99 per month and would include access to new features like bookmark collections and the Undo Tweets feature that Twitter had previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/twitter-might-let-you-undo-tweets-if-you-pay-a-subscription-fee\/\">confirmed to CNET<\/a> were being tested.<\/p>\n<p>However, when tech news site <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/5\/15\/22437690\/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets\">The Verge<\/a>\u00a0asked Twitter to comment on Twitter Blue, the company declined.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/s22.q4cdn.com\/826641620\/files\/doc_news\/2021\/05\/JPM-TMC-Conference-2021-Date-Announcement.pdf\">This week at<\/a> J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Global Technology, Media, and Communications conference, Twitter spelled things out a bit more clearly.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of vaguely hinting at forthcoming &#8220;experiments&#8221; or tests that gave &#8220;people and businesses of all sizes access to unique features,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/s22.q4cdn.com\/826641620\/files\/doc_downloads\/2021\/02\/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf\">as it said before<\/a> (gotta love that corporate speak!), Twitter CFO Ned Segal told investors its new &#8220;premium service&#8221; would be aimed at people who use Twitter&#8217;s service &#8212; &#8220;and they pay us for it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Segal noted this premium offering was one of the two types of subscriptions that Twitter had in the works, the other being Super Follows.<\/p>\n<p>The premium service also sounded less of an &#8220;experiment&#8221; than when Twitter had discussed its plans before. In earlier statements, it had seemed as if Twitter was embarking on some kind of research project to see if there was even any demand for a Twitter premium subscription at all. The wording the company used in the past didn&#8217;t make it clear how seriously this effort was.<\/p>\n<p>Segal said the company would offer more info about Twitter&#8217;s premium service in the coming months.

different approach to the business of finding new therapeutics, and it just raised $43 million to keep growing.<\/p>\n<p>Digital drug discovery in general means large-scale analysis of biological data like genes, gene expression, protein structures, binding sites, things like that. Where it has hit a wall in the past is not on the digital side, where any number of likely molecules or processes can be generated, but on the next step, when those notions need to be tested in vitro. So a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/daphne-koller-digital-biology-is-an-incredible-place-to-be-right-now\/\">new crop of biotech companies<\/a> have worked to integrate these aspects.<\/p>\n<p>Engine does so with a pair of tools it has dubbed NetMAPPR and CombiGEM. NetMAPPR is a huge sort of search engine for genes and gene interactions, taking special note of &#8220;errors&#8221; that could provide a foothold for a molecule or treatment. CombiGEM is like a mass genetic testing process that can look into thousands of gene combinations and edits on diseased cells simultaneously, providing quick experimental confirmation of the targets and effects proposed by the digital side. The company is focused on anti-cancer drugs but is looking into other fields as they become viable.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158015\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158015\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2158015\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Lu, Co-Founder and CEO, Engine Biosciences\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg 899w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jeffrey-Lu-Co-Founder-and-CEO-Engine-Biosciences.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Engine Biosciences<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The focus on gene interactions sets their approach apart, said co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Lu.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Gene interactions are relevant to all diseases, and in cancers, where we focus, a proven approach for effective precision medicines,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;For example, there are four approved drugs targeting the PARP enzyme in the context of mutation in the BRCA gene that is changing cancer treatment for millions of people. The fundamental principle of this precision medicine is based on understanding the gene interaction between BRCA and PARP.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/31\/engine-biosciences-raises-10-million-in-southeast-asias-largest-institutional-seed-round\/\"> raised a $10 million seed in 2018<\/a>\u00a0and has been doing its thing ever since \u2014 but it needs more money if it&#8217;s going to bring some of these things to market.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We already have chemical compounds directed toward the novel biology we have uncovered,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;These are effectively prototype drugs, which are showing anti-cancer effects in diseased cells. We need to refine and optimize these prototypes to a suitable candidate to enter the clinic for testing in humans.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Right now they&#8217;re working with other companies to do the next step up from automated testing, which is to say animal testing, to clear the way for human trials.<\/p>\n<p>The CombiGEM experiments \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 produce a large amount of data as well, and they&#8217;re sharing and collaborating on that front with several medical centers throughout Asia. &#8220;We have built what we believe to be the largest data compendium related to gene interactions in the context of cancer disease relevance,&#8221; said Lu, adding that this is crucial to the success of the machine learning algorithms they employ to predict biological processes.<\/p>\n<p>The $43 million round was led by Polaris Partners, with participation by newcomers Invus and a long list of existing investors. The money will go toward the requisite testing and paperwork involved in bringing a new drug to market based on promising leads.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have small molecule compounds for our lead cancer programs with data from in vitro (in cancer cells) experiments. We are refining the chemistry and expanding studies this year,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;Next year, we anticipate having our first drug candidate enter the late preclinical phase of development and regulatory work for an IND (investigational new drug) filing with the FDA, and starting the clinical trials in 2023.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a long road to human trials, let alone widespread use, but that&#8217;s the risk any drug discovery startup takes. The carrot dangling in front of them is not just the possibility of a product that could generate billions in income, but perhaps save the lives of countless cancer patients awaiting novel therapies.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gRIjTM5Zad\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/23\/2021-should-be-a-banner-year-for-biotech-startups-that-make-smart-choices-early\/\">2021 should be a banner year for biotech startups that make smart choices early<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;2021 should be a banner year for biotech startups that make smart choices early&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/23\/2021-should-be-a-banner-year-for-biotech-startups-that-make-smart-choices-early\/embed\/#?secret=gRIjTM5Zad\" data-secret=\"gRIjTM5Zad\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drug discovery is a large and growing field, encompassing both ambitious startups and billion-dollar Big Pharma incumbents.
